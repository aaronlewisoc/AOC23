## Run Guide
For simplicity open in IDE of choice (IntelliJ preferably...)

Run``./gradlew clean build`` for Unix-based systems, or
``sh gradlew clean build`` for windows command prompt to build the project.

Now utilising the run configuration file within
``.idea/runConfigurations/MainKt.xml`` Run:

## Breakdown
Every day of advent of code will have its own dedicated directory where the necessary classes will reside.

The answers method for each day will be called within the ``MainKt`` class, outputted to the console.

## Run Testing
``./gradlew clean build`` for Unix-based systems, or
``sh gradlew clean build`` for windows command prompt

The test classes can be found under ``src/test/kotlin/...``
